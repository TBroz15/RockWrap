<h3>
    Installation of typings.
</h3>

<p>
    If you would like to modify our wrapper for some special purposes, we <b>strongly recommend installing typings on your local producation</b>, to make your development easier and faster.
</p>

<p>
    Process is really easy, all you have to do is to check if you have NPM downloaded, then install packages via command in wrapper's folder:
</p>

```powershell
npm i  # Installs every package, declared in package.json
```

<p>
    And that's all, nothing more!
